## 📌 What This Repository Covers

- Data cleaning and preprocessing workflows
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Feature selection and transformation
- Scaling and normalization
- Preparing datasets for ML models
- Experimenting with multiple model-ready datasets

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- Preprocessing pipelines for ML
- Dataset exploration and refinement
- Feature engineering basics
- Model-wise data preparation
- Visualization to understand data behavior

The notebooks represent **iterative experimentation**, moving from raw data to final, usable inputs.
